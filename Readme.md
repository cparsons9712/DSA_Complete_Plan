# Complete DSA Study Plan Mastery Guide

## Welcome!
Welcome to the plan! This DSA Guide is intended to go through cycles of 10 weeks.
Each cycle will cover the same topics in the same order as the previous but will go more in depth.
Everytime you finish a cycle, you start over and move on to the more difficult path.
Each day/week will have more problems than you might be able to solve in that time frame, and thats ok! The goal is to complete 5 DSA questions a week, anything extra is to help cement it in your head if you have the time to do so.
<br>
Theres a compainion notion to go along with this, with more indepth instruction and teaching you more about what you need to know to solve the problems. With using the guide to learn you should have the skills necessary to complete every project listed for that week. You can find it here: <br>

I hope you enjoy and learn lots!
