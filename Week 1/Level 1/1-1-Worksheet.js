PROBLEM 1

Scenario:
Joe has a form in his frontend where he collects data then sends it to
the backend to be put into the database. He has found a bug where
users can enter anything into the form and have it send to the database.
This is a problem because when the backend tries to perform its business logic
an error is thrown. Help Joe make a function that will verify that the data
he gets from the form is a string.

Task:
Finish this function that verifies the input is a string. The function should
be returning true false.
